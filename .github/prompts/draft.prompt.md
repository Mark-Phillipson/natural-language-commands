I would like to be able to say the following:

 please list all the tables available in my database VoiceLauncher

  Visual Studio Code should open up a new SQL document and open up the list of connections with VoiceLauncher filtered. Maybe is this something that's feasible?

   I have SQL Server as one of my sidebars/extensions
