 can we devise some tests for the following scenarios:

 - User inputs a command that should be executed in the terminal.
 - User inputs a command that should be executed as a VS Code command.
 - User inputs a command that should open a file.
 - User inputs an ambiguous command that needs more clarification.
 - User inputs a command that triggers the help menu.
 - User asks to be transferred to copilot chat.
 - User inputs a command that opens the file menu.
 - User Asks a Question that is definitely not a command.
