When we select to run an existing  Visual Studio Code command and we type something to filter for it and it does not exist and all we have left is run new command,  when we press enter could whatever value we have used to try to filter be added to the New Command TextBox input?

The idea being if we accidentally type what we want to run for example a command and didn't really mean to filter we don't lose what we've already entered, So it saves us typing it all again.

When selecting to run an existing Visual Studio Code command, if the user types a filter that does not match any existing commands and is left with the option to "Run New Command," pressing enter should automatically populate the New Command TextBox with the text that was used for filtering. This feature would help prevent the loss of user input and save time by avoiding the need to retype the command they intended to run.

Please make this change to the extension.
