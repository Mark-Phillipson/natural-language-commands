Please can we have a sidebar that shows a history of all the commands that have been run for the current session with the ability to click one to re-run it?

The sidebar should be collapsible and resizable, and should show the command name, the time it was run, and any parameters that were passed to it. It should also have a search bar at the top to filter the commands by name or parameter. The most recent commands should be at the top of the list. There should also be a button to clear the history.
