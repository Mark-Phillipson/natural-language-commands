The command history sidebar it's not currently very voice friendly.

 instead of having the buttons appear when we hover could we have them displayed as icons all the time.  then when the mouse is hovered over the small icons they could expand to show the text.  this would make it easier to use with voice commands as the buttons would always be visible and not require a hover action to see them.

  also we need to be able to use the keyboard to tab onto the buttons and activate them with the enter key.  this would also make it easier to use with voice commands as we could say "tab" and then "enter" to activate the buttons.
