# Action Plan: VS Code Natural Language Command Extension

## 1. Project Initialization
- Set up a new VS Code extension project using the official Yeoman generator (`yo code`).
- Choose TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- Initialize version control (Git) and create a project repository.

## 2. Core Extension Architecture
- Define extension activation events (e.g., on command, on startup).
- Set up the extension manifest (`package.json`) with commands, contributions, and activation events.
- Implement a command handler to accept natural language input (via input box and, optionally, voice).

## 3. Natural Language Processing Integration
- Integrate with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Copilot) for intent recognition.
- Design a mapping layer to translate parsed intent into VS Code commands.
- Implement fallback and suggestion logic for ambiguous intents.

## 4. Command Execution & Confirmation
- Implement a confirmation dialog before executing any command.
- Provide alternative suggestions if confidence is low.
- Ensure all command executions are routed through a secure, confirmatory process.

## 5. Multi-step & Custom Commands
- Support parsing and execution of multi-step instructions.
- Allow users to define custom natural language triggers for specific commands or macros.
- Store custom mappings in extension settings or a local file.

## 6. Learning & Feedback Mechanism
- Implement a feedback UI for users to rate or correct command suggestions.
- Store feedback data securely and use it to improve intent mapping.
- Optionally, allow opt-in for sharing anonymized feedback for global model improvement.

## 7. Accessibility & Voice Workflow
- Ensure all UI elements are accessible (screen reader support, keyboard navigation).
- Test with accessibility tools and users.
- Recommend using the extension in conjunction with [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/) for hands-free, voice-driven workflows in VS Code.

## 8. Security & Privacy
- Always require user confirmation before executing commands, especially destructive ones.
```
