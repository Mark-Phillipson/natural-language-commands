# Action Plan: VS Code Natural Language Command Extension

## 1. Project Initialization ✅
- [x] Set up a new VS Code extension project using the official Yeoman generator (`yo code`).
- [x] Choose TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- [x] Initialize version control (Git) and create a project repository.

## 2. Core Extension Architecture ✅
- [x] Define extension activation events (e.g., on command, on startup).
- [x] Set up the extension manifest (`package.json`) with commands, contributions, and activation events.
- [x] Implement a command handler to accept natural language input (via input box and, optionally, voice).

## 3. Natural Language Processing Integration ✅
- [x] Integrate with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Copilot) for intent recognition.
- [x] Design a mapping layer to translate parsed intent into VS Code commands.
- [x] Implement fallback and suggestion logic for ambiguous intents.

## 4. Command Execution & Confirmation ✅
- [x] Implement a confirmation dialog before executing any command.
- [x] Provide alternative suggestions if confidence is low.
- [x] Ensure all command executions are routed through a secure, confirmatory process.

## 5. Multi-step & Custom Commands
- Support parsing and execution of multi-step instructions.
- Allow users to define custom natural language triggers for specific commands or macros.
- Store custom mappings in extension settings or a local file.

## 6. Learning & Feedback Mechanism
- Implement a chat interface to discuss the command you wish to run with the large language model
- Implement a feedback UI for users to rate or correct command suggestions.
- Store feedback data securely and use it to improve intent mapping.
- Optionally, allow opt-in for sharing anonymized feedback for global model improvement.

## 7. Accessibility & Voice Workflow
- Ensure all UI elements are accessible (screen reader support, keyboard navigation).
- Test with accessibility tools and users.
- Recommend using the extension in conjunction with [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/) for hands-free, voice-driven workflows in VS Code.

## 8. Security & Privacy
- Always require user confirmation before executing commands, especially destructive ones.

## 11. Future Enhancements
- Plan for deeper learning from user patterns and preferences.
- Add support for more complex workflows and macros.
- Integrate with additional accessibility tools.
- Enable community-shared custom prompt libraries.
