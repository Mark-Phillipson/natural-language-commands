## Accessibility & Productivity

This extension is designed to make VS Code more accessible and productive for everyone:

- **Accessibility:** Users who have difficulty remembering command names, keyboard shortcuts, or menu navigation can simply use natural language to perform actions. This is especially helpful for people with less-than-perfect memory or cognitive challenges.
- **Productivity:** No need to memorize complex key combinations or search through menus—just describe what you want to do in plain English.
- **Discoverability:** The extension’s command history makes it easy to recall and reuse previous actions, further reducing cognitive load.


# Natural Language Commands for VS Code

Created by Mark Phillipson

This extension lets you run VS Code commands using natural language. It integrates with OpenAI models (default: gpt-4o) to interpret your requests and map them to editor actions, simulated menus, and terminal commands.

## Features
- Run VS Code or terminal commands using plain English
- Simulated menus for File, Edit, Selection, View, Go, Run, Terminal, and Help (via QuickPick)
- Sidebar and activity bar navigation (including custom sidebars)
- Command history sidebar
- Choose your preferred OpenAI model
- Debug mode to show raw LLM responses
- Status bar alert icon for notifications
- PowerShell translation for terminal commands
- Confirmation and alternatives for low-confidence actions

## Usage

### Example Natural Language Commands
- "Open the file menu"
- "Show the edit menu"
- "Show all sidebars"
- "Open the terminal and run my tests"
- "Show command history sidebar"
- "Find all TODO comments in the workspace"
- "Open the explorer"
- "Show me my extensions"
- "Switch to the source control view"
- "Open settings in JSON view"
- "Create a new file called hello.txt"
- "Show me the output panel"
- "Run the build task"
- "Show me the problems panel"
- "Open the debug console"
- "Clear the command history"

### Simulated Menus
Native top menus (File, Edit, Selection, View, Go, Run, Terminal, Help) cannot be opened directly. Instead, this extension provides simulated menus via QuickPick with common actions for each menu. Just say or type e.g. "open the file menu" or "show the edit menu".

### Sidebar Navigation
Say "show all sidebars" to get a filterable list of all sidebars (Explorer, Source Control, Run & Debug, Extensions, etc.) and focus the one you select.

### Command History
The extension keeps a session-based and persistent command history, accessible via the custom sidebar.

## Extension Settings
- `naturalLanguageCommands.model`: OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-4o)
- `naturalLanguageCommands.debugShowRawResponse`: Show raw LLM response (default: false)
- `naturalLanguageCommands.confidenceThresholds`: Object with `autoAccept` and `confirm` values (defaults: 0.9 and 0.7). Controls when commands are auto-executed, require confirmation, or show alternatives:
	- If confidence ≥ `autoAccept`, the command is auto-executed.
	- If confidence ≥ `confirm` but < `autoAccept`, you are asked for confirmation.
	- If confidence < `confirm`, alternatives are shown or the chat sidebar is opened.
	- Set `autoAccept` to 1 to always ask for confirmation (current behavior). Set to 0 to always auto-accept (advanced users only).


## Providing Your OpenAI API Key

This extension requires a valid OpenAI API key to function. You can provide your key in one of two ways:

### 1. Securely via the Command Palette (Recommended)

- Run the command **"Set OpenAI API Key"** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > type "Set OpenAI API Key").
- Enter your OpenAI API key (it will be stored securely using VS Code's SecretStorage and never synced or exposed).
- To remove your key, run **"Remove OpenAI API Key"** from the Command Palette.

### 2. Using an Environment Variable

- Create a file named `.env` in the extension root folder (or your workspace root).
- Add the following line:
	```
	OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
	```
- Restart VS Code after editing the `.env` file.

If both are set, the extension will use the key from secure storage first.

If the key is missing, you will be prompted to set it using the command above.

## Limitations
- Native top menus cannot be opened (simulated via QuickPick only)
- Requires valid OpenAI API key (see above)

## Voice Control
This extension can be used in conjunction with [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/) to further enhance your workflow with hands-free, voice-driven commands in VS Code.

## Release Notes
### 1.0.0
Initial release with core features and simulated menus.
