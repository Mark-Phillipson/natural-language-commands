# VS Code Natural Language Command Extension

## Summary
An extension for Visual Studio Code that allows users to execute any command or sequence of commands using natural language, with confirmation, suggestions, and learning capabilities. The extension is designed to improve accessibility, productivity, and user experience, especially for users with disabilities or those unfamiliar with all VS Code commands.

## Problem Statement
Many users find it difficult to remember or discover the vast array of commands and shortcuts in Visual Studio Code. Users with accessibility needs (e.g., repetitive strain injury, visual impairments) may struggle to interact with small UI elements or use the keyboard/mouse extensively. There is currently no seamless way to control VS Code using natural language.

## Feature Overview
- Accepts natural language input (typed or spoken)
- Interprets intent using an AI language model
- Maps intent to one or more VS Code commands
- Presents a confirmation dialog before executing
- Offers suggestions or alternatives if unsure
- Learns from user feedback and adapts over time
- Supports multi-step and custom commands
- Integrates with Copilot or similar AI tools

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Command Input:** Users can type or speak requests (e.g., "Open the terminal and run my tests").
- **Intent Recognition:** Uses an LLM to parse and understand user intent.
- **Command Mapping:** Suggests the most likely VS Code command(s) to match the intent.
- **Confirmation & Suggestions:** Asks for confirmation before executing, and offers alternatives if confidence is low.
- **Learning & Feedback:** Collects user feedback to improve accuracy and personalization.
- **Multi-step Commands:** Breaks down complex instructions into sequential actions.
- **Custom Prompts:** Allows users to define their own natural language triggers for specific commands or macros.
- **Accessibility Focus:** Designed for users who cannot use a keyboard or mouse easily.

## User Stories

- **As a user with repetitive strain injury,** I want to run any VS Code command using my voice or natural language, so I can avoid using the keyboard or mouse.
- **As a new VS Code user,** I want to describe what I want to do in plain English and have the extension suggest the right command, so I donâ€™t have to memorize shortcuts.
- **As a power user,** I want to chain multiple actions in one natural language request (e.g., "Open a new terminal, run build, then open the output folder"), so I can work more efficiently.
- **As a user with visual impairment,** I want to avoid clicking small UI elements and instead use natural language to control the editor.
- **As a developer,** I want to provide feedback when the extension gets a command wrong, so it can learn and improve over time.
- **As a user,** I want to review and confirm the suggested command before it is executed, to prevent mistakes.
- **As a user,** I want to create custom natural language prompts that map to my favorite commands or macros, so I can personalize my workflow.

## Technical Considerations
- **VS Code Extension API:** Use the API to execute commands, show dialogs, and interact with the UI.
- **AI Integration:** Use an LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Copilot) for intent parsing and command mapping.
- **Voice Input:** Optionally integrate with speech-to-text APIs for hands-free operation.
- **Security:** Always require confirmation before executing commands, especially destructive ones.
- **Privacy:** Handle user data and feedback securely and transparently.
- **Extensibility:** Allow users to add custom mappings and macros.

## Future Enhancements
- **Deeper learning from user patterns and preferences**
- **Support for more complex, multi-step workflows**
- **Integration with other accessibility tools**
- **Community-shared custom prompt libraries**
